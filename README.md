# CompRobo-Warmup-Project
Kenta Terasaki, Mihir Vemuri
For the warmup comprobo project we explored the robot platform for the course, a Neato vacuuming robot with a raspberry pi controller board. We configured it with ROS(Robot Operating System), Python in VS Code, simulated our code in the Gazebo simulator, and debugged utilizing rviz and rqt. Our main task in this project was to equip the neato with a set of behaviors, which we did utilizng our control scheme. The programs we created were a teleoperation mode for direct user control, wall following, obstacle avoidance, person following, square driving, and a finite state controller to switch between behaviors.
